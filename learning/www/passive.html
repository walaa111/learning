-We use the active form to say what the subject does.
<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li>I speak English every day at work.</li>
<li>I repaired the flat tire on the car.</li>

</ul>
-We use the passive form to say what happens to people and things, to say what is done to them.
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li>English is spoken here.</li>
  <li>The car is being repaired.</li>
</ul>

-We use the passive form when we don't know who did the action.
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The car was damaged while it was parked on the street.</li>
  <li>The shirts were made in Turkey.</li>
</ul>
-We use the passive form when what was done is more important than who did it.
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
  <li>It was approved by Gerry last week.</li>
  <li>I was informed by the Human Resources Manager only two days ago.</li>
</ul>
