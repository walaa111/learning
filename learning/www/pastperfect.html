We use the past perfect simple to talk about what happened before a point in the past. It looks back from a point in the past to further in the past.
<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li>I hadn't known the bad news when I spoke to him.</li>
<li>I checked with the supplier and they still hadn't received the contract.</li>
<li>She had already told him before I got a chance to give him my version.</li>
<li>The company has started the year well but was badly hit by the postal strike.</li>
